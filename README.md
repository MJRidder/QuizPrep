# Testing
Testing of the various pages has been an ongoing process. Ensuring that mobile comes first has the benefit that overall the pages are tailored for it and will indeed look most streamlined on mobile. It has however ensured that in some cases the page look different on larger screens.

Testing has been performed on actual laptops and phone screens (Macbook pro & Samsung Galaxy S23).
